## What is Encoder-Decoder model ?
An encoder-decoder model is a type of neural network architecture commonly used in machine learning tasks that involve sequence-to-sequence mapping. This architecture consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder.

#### Encoder:
The encoder is responsible for processing the input sequence and transforming it into a fixed-dimensional representation, often called the "context" or "latent representation." This context contains the essential information from the input sequence in a condensed form. Typically, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are used as encoder architectures.

#### Decoder:
The decoder takes the fixed-dimensional representation generated by the encoder and uses it to generate the output sequence. It processes this context information and produces a sequence of outputs. Similar to the encoder, recurrent neural networks or other architectures suitable for sequence generation are often used as decoders
